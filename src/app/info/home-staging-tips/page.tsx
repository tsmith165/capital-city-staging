            Preparing your home for sale can be a daunting task. At Capital City Staging, we've compiled a list of expert tips and tricks to help you stage your home effectively and attract potential buyers.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            1. Declutter Your Space
          </h2>
          <p>
            Remove unnecessary items to create a sense of space. A clutter-free home appears larger and allows buyers to focus on the property's features.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            2. Depersonalize the Home
          </h2>
          <p>
            Take down personal photographs and mementos. This helps buyers envision themselves living in the space, which can increase their emotional connection to the property.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            3. Make Minor Repairs
          </h2>
          <p>
            Fix leaky faucets, squeaky doors, and chipped paint. Small repairs can significantly improve the overall impression of your home.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            4. Enhance Curb Appeal
          </h2>
          <p>
            First impressions matter. Mow the lawn, trim hedges, and consider adding potted plants near the entrance to make your home inviting from the outside.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            5. Optimize Lighting
          </h2>
          <p>
            Open curtains and blinds to let in natural light. Ensure all bulbs are working and consider using higher wattage bulbs to brighten rooms.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            6. Neutralize Color Schemes
          </h2>
          <p>
            Use neutral colors for walls and d√©cor to appeal to a broader range of buyers. Neutral tones create a blank canvas for buyers to imagine their own style.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            7. Arrange Furniture Strategically
          </h2>
          <p>
            Position furniture to highlight the flow of the room and create cozy conversation areas. Avoid blocking windows or natural pathways.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            8. Keep It Clean
          </h2>
          <p>
            A spotless home signals to buyers that the property has been well-maintained. Pay attention to details like clean windows, dust-free surfaces, and fresh-smelling air.
          </p>
