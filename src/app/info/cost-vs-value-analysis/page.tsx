            One of the most common questions homeowners ask is whether the cost of home staging is
            worth the investment. At Capital City Staging, we believe that understanding the
            cost-benefit analysis is crucial. This page delves into how staging can provide a
            significant return on investment (ROI) by increasing your home's value and reducing time
            on the market.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            The Financial Impact of Home Staging
          </h2>
          <p>
            Home staging is more than an expense; it's an investment. According to industry
            statistics, staged homes often sell for 6-20% more than non-staged homes. Additionally,
            they spend 73% less time on the market. These factors can greatly offset the initial
            staging costs.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            Breakdown of Staging Costs
          </h2>
          <p>
            The cost of staging varies depending on the size of your home, the amount of work
            needed, and the duration the home will be on the market. Typical costs include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Initial Consultation Fee</li>
            <li>Design and Planning</li>
            <li>Furniture and Decor Rental</li>
            <li>Staging Implementation</li>
            <li>Monthly Maintenance (if applicable)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            Potential Returns on Investment
          </h2>
          <p>
            Let's consider an example:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Without Staging:</strong> Home listed at $500,000. After several months on the
            market, the price is reduced to $480,000 to attract buyers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>With Staging:</strong> Initial staging cost is $3,000. The home sells within a
            few weeks at $510,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this scenario, staging not only prevented a price reduction but also resulted in a
            higher sale price, yielding a net gain of $27,000 after subtracting staging costs.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            Time Savings Equals Money Saved
          </h2>
          <p>
            Every day your home sits on the market costs you money in terms of mortgage payments,
            utilities, and maintenance. By selling your home faster, staging can reduce these
            carrying costs significantly.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-100">
            Avoiding Price Reductions
          </h2>
          <p>
            Homes that linger on the market often face price reductions. Buyers may perceive a
            long-listed home as less desirable. Staging can help you avoid these reductions by
            generating interest quickly.
          </p>
